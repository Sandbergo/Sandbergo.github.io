    <br>Welcome to my personal webpage! <br><br>
    I'm an engineering student living in Trondheim working on applying mathematics and computational power to solve difficult problems. 
    <br>In my internships I have implemented data driven algorithms for performing computational quantum mechanics
    and developed a platform for using AI-methods to discover patterns in tax data. 
    At the moment I'm working on my master thesis on applying Machine Learning to improve Mathematical Programming algorithms. <br><br>
    I also host my miniature blog here, feel free to check it out.
