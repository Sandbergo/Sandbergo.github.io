    <br>Welcome to my personal webpage! <br><br>
    I am a software engineer living in Oslo, where I write modern C++ and Python for Linux platforms.
    <br>In my internships I have implemented data driven algorithms for performing computational quantum mechanics
    and developed a platform for using AI-methods to discover patterns in tax data. 
    And I wrote my master's thesis on applying Machine Learning to improve Mathematical Programming algorithms. <br><br>
    I also host my miniature blog here, feel free to check it out, and contact me on LinkedIn if you have any questions.
