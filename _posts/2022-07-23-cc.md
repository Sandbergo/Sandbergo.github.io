title: "Review of Clean Code (2008) by Robert C. Martin"
---

My short review of the software engineering classic <it>Clean Code</it> by Robert C. Martin, with the tagline <it>A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship </it>.  

### Main takeaways 

### Main Criticisms

### Review summary

In conclusion, I would advise software engineers writing in an Object Oriented and/or Test Driven style to read or skim through the book. However, I would take the code examples with a grain of salt, as well as skip the last chapters. It contains a number of good rules and perspectives, especially when it comes to Test Driven Design (TDD), but the style is somewhat outdated and may best be supplemented with a more modern and hybrid design approach, in my opinion.

Score: 4/6
